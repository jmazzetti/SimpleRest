# RestFullTest

## About

This simple Spring Boot project is intended to show how to deploy a RESTful application (POST, GET, DELETE, PATCH AND PUT) using MYSQL.


## Structure

Inside the pom.xml structure I added few spring features:

 - Spring Actuator
 - Spring Cloud
 - Swagger Integration
 
## Test and Documentation

To see the generated documentation and test the API, access to:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html 

#Recomendations
